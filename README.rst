.. teaser-start

``keras-adf`` provides implementations for probabilistic
`Tensorflow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_/`Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ neural network layers,
which are based on assumed density filtering.
Assumed density filtering (ADF) is a general concept from Bayesian inference, but in the case of feed-forward neural networks that we consider here
it is a way to approximately propagate a random distribution through the neural network.

The layers in this package have the same names and arguments as their corresponding
Keras version. We use Gaussian distributions for our ADF approximations, which are
described by their means and (co-)variances. So unlike the standard Keras layers,
each ``keras-adf`` layer takes two inputs and produces two outputs (one for the means
and one for the (co-)variances).

.. example

``keras-adf`` layers can be used exactly like the corresponding `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_
layers within a Keras model. However, as mentioned above, ADF layers take two inputs and produce two outputs
instead of one, so it is not possible to simply mix ADF and standard layers within the same model.

.. code-block:: python

    from tensorflow.keras import Input, Model
    from kerasadf.layers import Dense

    in_mean = Input((10,))
    in_var = Input((10,))
    out_mean, out_var  = Dense(10, activation="relu")([in_mean, in_var])
    model = Model([in_mean, in_var], [out_mean, out_var])

The `Overview <https://keras-adf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>`_ and
`Examples <https://keras-adf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_ sections
of our documentation provide more realistic and complete examples.
