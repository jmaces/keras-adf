    probabilistic networks
        Probabilistic networks refer to any type of neural network involving
        probabilistic quantities (random variables). Typically these arise in
        context of Bayesian inference (Bayesian neural networks). The
        randomness can be used to model uncertainties in the input data, or
        also the model parameters. Applications include uncertainty quantification
        for neural networks and explaining or interpreting network predictions.
